Version: 0.3.0
Title: Landscape Utility Toolbox
Description: Toolbox designed to support some of the less-glamorous 
    tasks involved in most landscape analysis. It includes functions to coerce
    raster data to the common tibble format and vice versa, it helps with 
    flexible reclassification tasks of raster data and provides a function to 
    merge multiple raster. Furthermore, landscapetools helps landscape 
    scientist to visualize their data by providing opionated themes 
    and utility functions to plot rasterstacks, -bricks and lists of rasters.
